\section{Task Description}
\label{task}

Use the Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008 Data Set. This dataset contains
records with 55 features for more than 100000 patients. 55 features include information
about the diabetic encounters, including demographics, diagnoses, diabetic medications,
number of visits in the year preceding the encounter, and payer information. Note that
even though some attributes are codified using numeric values, they are nominal (not
numeric) attributes. Browse additional information about the attributes in the paper
cited on the dataset website. The goal of this assignment is to find suitable methods in the area of machine learning to determine the readmission attribute of a patient and to estimate the quality of selected approaches.

In order to achieve this goal, the following tasks have to be completed:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[\textbullet] analyse the data set and its various attributes
	\item[\textbullet] clean the data (e.g. missing values)
	\item[\textbullet] select an appropriate subset of the attributes and explain your choice
	\item[\textbullet] use different suitable machine learning algorithms (either implement them, or use existing libraries, e.g. Weka)

	\item[\textbullet] determine the quality of your model (e.g. through cross-validation, log loss3, confusion matrix)
	\item[\textbullet] compare your results between different algorithms
\end{itemize}

Specifically, different suitable machine learning algorithms should include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[\textbullet] at least two classification algorithms, one of which, SVM, you learn during the course
	\item[\textbullet] at least one algorithm for semi-supervised classification. Use a part of the dataset	as unlabeled data for learning (omit the label)
\end{itemize}
