\section{Conclusion}

While solving the task of evaluating different classifiers on the basis of the provided \textit{UCI} data set we came across 
different problems. A lot of thought was put into preprocessing and the selection of attributes, with the best results 
coming from a sparsely edited set.

Experiments showed no surprise with \textit{Support Vector Machines} getting the best results with about 60.4\%. \textit{YATSI} has performed poorly in 
comparison to the other classifiers. The focus of additional work could be the analysis of it's behavior to explain or 
even improve it's performance.

Easing up the classification to a binary problem improved the results classifiers achieve. While this is not a method 
applicable in this task, it could come in handy for future ones.
