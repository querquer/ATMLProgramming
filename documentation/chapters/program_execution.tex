\section{Program Execution}
\label{program_execution}

In order to execute our program you need to open a console and enter the following command:
\begin{center}
	\texttt{java -jar <PATH TO JAR>\ATMLProgramming.jar}
\end{center}
The database file should be saved in the same directory as the jar file.
After executing the jar file the menu will guide you through the whole program and ask for some parameters before the classification starts.
